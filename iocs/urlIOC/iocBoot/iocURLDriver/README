This IOC can run on different platforms.  

To run on win32-x86 with st.cmd.windows edit Makefile to set ARCH to win32-x86,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.windows.

To run on linux-x86 with st.cmd.linux edit Makefile to set ARCH to linux-x86,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.linux.
